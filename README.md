# Pneumonia Detection Using Support Vector Machines and Deep Neural Networks

## Model Description
This model leverages the **DenseNet169** architecture to extract relevant features from X-ray images, with the model's approach being detailed in [this article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8869364). The model integrates a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on the specifications discussed in the article and combines it with a Deep Neural Network in a stacked ensemble format. This methodology has achieved an **accuracy of 87%** on chest X-ray data.
